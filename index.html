            Hello and welcome to my personal blog site!
            This is where I show off my funny little projects.
            They're usually programming or ecology related.
        </p>

            I'm working on software to help revitalize endangered languages across the globe.
            I want something free and open-source that various communities with different linguistic needs can benefit from.
            This project is being developed in Kotlin and TypeScript.
        </p>

            This is my first 3D game.
            I would describe it as a cross between Civilization and Pok√©mon.
            I'm writing the game in Java and LibGDX.
            Stay tuned for more.
