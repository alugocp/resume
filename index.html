        <!-- Biography -->
        <p>
            Hello, and welcome!
            I'm an Indigenous (Ta√≠no and Chichimeca) developer and artist trying to do some good in the world.
            I love creating things - mostly through design and programming, but I also enjoy learning about gardening, cooking, writing, animation, architecture, and various other creative mediums.
            I'm almost always either making something, learning about some topic, playing a game or watching a cartoon.
            I love history and cultural studies, and I always try to work on multidisciplinary projects.
            Recently I've been doing more hands-on hardware and gardening projects, like modifying my own furniture and starting some compost piles.
        </p>
        <p>
            I graduated from the University of Maryland in December of 2020.
            It had come after various other accomplishments throughout high school and college - including congressional awards, joining a bioinformatics lab, starting a YouTube channel, working for various startups, and eventually launching my own.
            I don't do as much these days, but I like to keep focused on a handful of more impactful projects.
            I don't want to develop and promote a large project unless I know it will help someone and make a real difference.
        </p>
