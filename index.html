        <p class="extra-space">
            Hello and welcome!
            I'm an Indigenous (Ta√≠no and Guachichil) software engineer trying to do some good in the world.
            I love creating things - mostly through design and programming, but I also enjoy more traditional mediums like visual art.
            I'm almost always either making something or learning something new.
            Recently I've been doing more hands-on hardware and ecological projects, like modifying my own furniture and rewilding my yard with native plants.
        </p>
        <p>
            I graduated from the University of Maryland in December of 2020.
            It had come after various other accomplishments throughout high school and college - including <a href="https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/">congressional awards</a>, helping with <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31340155/">cancer research</a> at a bioinformatics lab, starting a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/alexlugo">YouTube channel</a>, working for various startups, and eventually launching <a href="http://lugocorp.net/">my own company</a>.
            I don't do as much these days, but I still save time for projects.
            Normally I would start projects for projects' sake, but recently I've been keeping focused on a handful of more impactful ideas.
            I don't want to develop and promote anything unless I know it will help someone and make a real difference.
        </p>
