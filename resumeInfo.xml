			<title>More About This Site</title>
			<full>I got the idea to build this site in my junior year of high school. I needed a project to do, and around then I had been giving out resumes to multiple jobs and colleges. The concept of this site began as a database of sorts that I could pull from to make my resumes more easily. As I got more comfortable with being a professional programmer, I began just using this site as my resume. Since then it's evolved some of the aspects of an auto-biography or even a blog.</full>

			<summary>
				Xochitl is a Nahuatl word that comes from the name Xochipilli, the Aztec god of art.
				Xochitl is officially the first programming language I've ever built. Its primary use is to create mathematically-precise SVG graphics. The icon you see to the right was actually one of the first images I designed in Xochitl.
				As a fan of out-there languages and paradigms, I tried to make Xochitl as weird as I possibly could while still justifying all my design choices. The language is graph-based, which gives it strange properties like non-importance of the order of source code lines.
				There are also functional, logical and object-oriented elements sprinkled throughout the language for good measure. Having finally built it, I'm extremely proud of what this language has become.
				I plan on using Xochitl to give all my projects a unique aesthetic identity using infinitely-scaling vector graphics.
			</summary>
			<full>
				Xochitl went through various different iterations as I learned more about language design. At first I had the interpreter read the source code without any bytecode conversion, but obviously that made the language too slow.
				Xochitl's next iteration saw the introduction of a simple virtual machine prototype. The language had a procedural/imperative paradigm back then with syntax heavily inspired by Ruby, C and Lisp (but it was basically a Python ripoff).
				A year later I would finally completely redesign the language as a Node library with accompanying IDE. The current design compiles Xochitl source code directly into an SVG-format vector graphic.

The inspiration bug bit me and I just couldn't help but make another CivSim program. This version is everything I dreamed about when I built the first two. It revisits concepts found in my previous CivSim projects while introducing some entirely new ones (such as culture and language).</summary>
			<full>The program uses a neural network AI and allows you to take a closer look at cities like version 1 did, but it also brings back the hexagonal city shape and city interactions of version 2. Version 3 also has some new features, such as much larger continents and a cultural landscape map. Civs in this version can fight, expand, merge, rebel, colonize distant coasts, affect local culture/language, harvest nearby resources and learn new skills. Version 3 also comes in two different modes: simulation and player mode. Simulation mode lets you sit back and watch history happen before your very eyes. Player mode actually puts you in control of one of the nations. Every action you make is logged on decision files. I built a script in Ruby that can process those decision files to create an AI brain for use in the game. It's my hope to continue experimenting with imitative AI's such as this one. The simulation pictured to the right used an AI based on my own brain to control each civilization.</full>

			<full>I wrote a server-side script in R that can read gene expression and clinical data from around 2000 different cancer patients. I also wrote a client-side webapp using Shiny R and Javascript that requests and visualizes data gathered from the server. The result is an interactive web-based application that allows users to see how certain genes (and how strongly they're expressed) affect cancer survival. I used R for this program because it makes statistical analysis and visualization easy (it has a built-in Kaplan-Meier function for survival analysis), and because the Shiny package makes it easy to develop dynamic server-based webapps in R.

			<title>CivSim 2.0</title>
			<info label="Developed">August/September 2016</info>
			<info label="Languages">Java (prototype), Python</info>
			<download>civsim2.py</download>
			<summary>A better version of the Civilization Simulator I had built a few months before. Whereas version 1 was based on neural networks, this version utilizes sensory networks and a prioritization algorithm. This version also focuses more on interactions between nations instead of competition for (and depletion of) resources.</summary>
			<full>It took me about one week to program the prototype in Java. It took me another week to learn Python and rewrite the final version. I felt that a dynamically-typed language would better optimize the project. I used a mainly functional paradigm when creating this project, as opposed to version 1's purely object-oriented approach. Python's Tkinter module caused some optimization issues, but I've minimized them. This project is everything I wished version 1 was. When you boot up the program it generates a random continent complete with a handful of cities. These cities send requests to their emperors based on their surroundings (like a sensory network) and the emperors decide which requests to appease and which to ignore. Throughout the course of each simulation, cities will fight other cities, establish new cities for their emperor, and sometimes secede from their empire to start a dissident nation. Bordering nations of similar size merge together, to ensure that new empires form throughout the artificial timeline. A histogram that graphs the size of each nation over time is generated as the simulation runs, so one can see the complete history of any given simulation after it has terminated. My last update to this project was to allow nations to cross water and colonize distant coasts/islands, for a slightly more accurate recreation of real history.</full>

			<title>Civilization Simulator (CivSim)</title>
			<info label="Developed">Summer 2016</info>
			<info label="Languages">Java</info>
			<summary>During the summer of 2016, I developed a simulation for competing nations and empires run by neural network AI's.</summary>
			<full>The concept for the project grew of my interest and curiosity with the rise and fall of civilizations. I tend to be a bit of a philomath when it comes to how different societies mingle, battle, grow powerful, and crumble throughout time. After passing AP World History I needed a new source to indulge this curiosity of mine, so I created the CivSim program. The program uses a continent generator based on one I had built in Javascript a few months before. This simulation, however, was coded wholly in Java (making extensive use of the java.awt library). The program was my first attempt at programming an AI. I used a simple neural-network structure to replicate thought and self-learning. Each AI controls a single nation and has 11 inputs (senses), 8 outputs (actions), and up to 88 synapses. I implemented some simple code to judge the outcome of an AI's actions. If the outcome was destructive to the AI, the AI would try something new the next time. This led to a self-improving neural network that could compete with its rivals for resources. I continue to tweak the program to ensure each simulation will see multiple dominating empires rise and fall throughout the runtime, rather than simply one empire dominating a single sim. The populations of each nation are recorded in a histogram, to give me analyzable data concerning which nations rise, dominate, and fall at what time in the simulation. The program will be complete when one can clearly see political dominance passing fluidly from society to society before the continent completely runs out of resources and they all die out.</full>

			<summary>Little Elf in its latest incarnation is an unfinished Android platformer.</summary>
			<full>I had originally worked on this game in an attempt to create a new platforming experience for me to enjoy. None of the platformers on Google Play interested me, so I decided to make my own. The graphics were hand-drawn and then digitally colored and animated by me. The game still lacks multiple graphical assets, including a sprite for the player character. I had lost interest in the project for a few months but then decided to resurrect it for the 2015 Congressional App Challenge, where it won me first place for district 5 of Maryland. The game is completely hard-coded in Java using Eclipse's ADT plugin, before Google released Android Studio. I am not very proud of the code that went in to building this game, since most of it was developed before I had my current understanding of Android development. To list one downfall of the overall project, the game will only work on my phone's specific screen size and screen density. I have received much feedback to the effect that I should publish the game on Google Play. Should I ever do that, however, I would first restart the entire project's code (and perhaps its graphical assets as well) from scratch.</full>

			<summary>Unleash devastating power-ups to battle through hordes of cute cartoonish enemies on your way to save a kidnapped prince.</summary>
			<full>An Android game that I used to love working on, but then school started up again and I lost the time to work on it. I really would like to finish this some day, though it would be nice to team up with an artist so I could focus just on coding.</full>

			<title>Web Development</title>
			<summary>I am comfortable with calling myself a web developer, given my previous work experience and current knowledge on the subject. I can use HTML, CSS and Javascript - what I like to call the holy trinity of web development.</summary>
			<full>I am completely fluent in the Javascript language, and have worked on both front-end and back-end scripts. I have experience with jQuery, Bootstrap and PHP. I've even written my own front-end JS framework called WebStatic.</full>

		<entry>
			<title>Android and Java</title>
			<summary>I have made many games and other programs for my Android phone, though none of them have been published to Google Play as of yet.</summary>
			<full>Web and Android are my two best platforms to develop on, since they are the two I've had the most access to. I have over two years of experience with Android development, mainly game creation. I excel mainly in the functionality and 2D graphics portion of Android game development. As for desktop Java apps, I have less experience with UI than I do in Android. However, Java is my dominant language in terms of functional programming.</full>
		</entry>
		<entry>
			<title>C/C++</title>
			<full>I taught myself basic C++ between high school and college and then took a class on C my freshman year. I've mastered most low-level concepts and am currently finishing up a year-long C++ project. C is one of my favorite languages to code in simply because of how fast it runs and how much control I have when optimizing my code.</full>
		</entry>
		<entry>
			<title>Rust</title>
			<full>
				In addition to C/C++ I also love the Rust programming language.
				I haven't kept up with the bleeding edge compiler releases but I'm becoming more and more comfortable using it for lower-level, high-performance purposes.
				See the donut-hashing algorithm in my past projects section for an example of my work in Rust.

			<title>Python</title>
			<full>I had originally learned this language in a week when I was working on my CivSim 2.0 project. I've since come bask to master it, and it is now one of my favorite languages to code in. I especially love to prototype and script in Python. I prefer R for data science applications, but I still occasionally use Python for it from time to time.</full>
		</entry>
		<entry>
			<title>R</title>
			<full>I've got both an understanding and an appreciation for the R programming language. While the design (which is geared more towards non-coders) occasionally throws me off, it's so perfectly fit towards its purpose of statistical data analysis and visualization. I love the developer community built around this language and I enjoy the option of writing scripts or using the interactive terminal.</full>

			<title>Ruby</title>
			<summary>I think Ruby is one of the prettiest languages I know, even though I don't use it as often as I'd like. My recent gateway into Ruby was its Rails framework, since I had wanted to learn professional web platforms and frameworks.</summary>
			<full>Ruby was actually the first language I had ever learned, although all I really knew was <code>puts</code> and <code>gets.chomp</code> back in fourth grade.</full>

			<title>Functional Programming</title>
			<full>
				I admit it, I like functional programming.
				I've done some stuff in OCaml, which I'd regard as my most used functional language.
				I want to branch out into Haskell and Scala at some point.

			<title>Linux</title>
			<full>I develop on a Ubuntu laptop, so I know how to use Linux. I have some experience with networking using ssh requests, and I know all the basics of the command line. I also script my own developer tools in Bash.</full>

			<title>SQL</title>
			<full>
				I have used SQL (particularly MySQL) in several jobs, including WordPress sites, C#.NET legacy code and my own Cyan Pepper project (see past projects).
				I have no troubles using the MySQL database management system to perform basic tasks.

			<title>UMD Internship</title>
			<info label="During">2016 - 2017 school year</info>
			<summary>During the 2016-2017 school year (my senior year), I had an internship with the University of Maryland's (UMD) Institute for Advanced Computer Science. I worked in the Biomolecular Sciences building under the mentorship of <a href="http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~sridhar/">Professor Sridhar Hannenhalli</a>.</summary>
			<full>4 days a week I would take the city bus to UMD and then go to school afterwards. At UMD I worked on my Cancer Survival App (more information on that can be found in the Past Projects section). I worked with both professors and interns to design the app and learn more about UMIACS's networking infrastructure. I did all the coding, but they told me what the app should do and provided me with the means to develop it. During the course of this internship I worked extensively with Shiny R and Unix networking commands. I was given a few webspaces on UMD's server clusters. During testing I was able to upload my code to their ibis cluster so that I could use their cancer survival data.</full>

			<title>Appfluent, Inc.</title>
			<summary>I had worked on minor web development for about 4 weeks for this company.</summary>
			<full>During January of 2015, my father had notified me that the company he worked for, Appfluent, was looking for an independent contractor to do some minor web development work for them. Naturally I told him I'd love to do the work. Appfluent had multiple license text files they wanted to publish onto their web app. My job was to convert the license files to html (adding tags and such). After that was done, I created a stylesheet to apply to the files. I was also tasked with coding a sort of hub site where one could access links to all the licenses. I then added a link to that page to the main web app. After I had finished my work, Appfluent was bought out by Attunity. Attunity didn't have any reason to keep a 16-year old contractor on their payroll, so they opted not to renew my contract.</full>
