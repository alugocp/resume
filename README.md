# Personal website
This is my personal biography website.
It's a way to share some of my project highlights and accomplishments with people who are interested in my work.
It's not supposed to be anything fancy.

## Local Development
Run a dev server for local development with the following command:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 2017
```

## Pushing Changes
Push changes to the `main` branch only, GitHub hosts the static site from that one.
