# Personal website
This is my personal biography website.
It's a way to share some of my project highlights and accomplishments with people who are interested in my work.
It's not supposed to be anything fancy.

## Development
- Push to the `main` branch
- Run dev server (from within this repository)

```bash
python3 -m http.server 2017
```
