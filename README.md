# Personal website
This is my personal biography website.
It's a way to share some of my project highlights and accomplishments with people who are interested in my work.
It's not supposed to be anything fancy.

## TODO
- [x] Build out basic project file layout
- [x] Add the sections to the main page
- [x] Throw in some biographical text content
- [x] Style it so it's pretty
- [x] Add contact links (with social media icons)
- [ ] Find nice graphics for the main page
- [ ] Create a projects page based off the main page
